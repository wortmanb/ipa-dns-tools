# ipa-dns-tools
Scriptlets for working with DNS entries through IPA

## Background
I grew weary of looking up the ipa dns* commands whenever I had a DNS task to
perform, and we often had to do multiple operartions on behalf of a single
system, or perform bulk changes. These helper functions grew out of that
frustration.

## Contributing

If you have contributions or enhancements, please feel free to send me pull
requests. I'll also take feature requests, suggestions, and of course bug
reports.

Thanks,
